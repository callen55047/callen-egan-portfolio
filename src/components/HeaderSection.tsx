        Passionate <strong>Mobile Software Engineer</strong> with a deep-rooted foundation in object-oriented programming.
        I started my journey in game development, writing C++ code to bring interactive experiences to life.
        This early exposure to performance optimization and scalable architecture laid the groundwork for my career in building robust, multi-platform applications.
        Today, I leverage a diverse skill set across <strong>Swift</strong>, <strong>Kotlin</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>Dart</strong>, and <strong>C#</strong> to craft seamless mobile experiences.
        Whether it's optimizing gameplay features or designing an intuitive user interface, my focus is on delivering efficient, scalable, and maintainable solutions.
